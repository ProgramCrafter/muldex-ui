## Description

Asynchronous calls to smart contracts have been mocked-up.
We desidned UI for exchanging one token for another token, a UI for creating a pool with two tokens, a UI for adding and removing liquidity from a pool, a UI with a list of pools and pool statistics.

We used Typescript+React+Redux stack with a small help of Bootstrap and Sass. Express was used to mock our data.

When considering the design options, we focused on the ton.org site, UI of standard wallets and bridge, as well as Responsive Web Design.
